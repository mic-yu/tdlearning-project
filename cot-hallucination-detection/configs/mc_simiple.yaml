# Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation Config
# Dataset: ~70k reasoning traces, ~20k incorrect (≈29% error rate)

algo: mc

# Model
model-name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct"
freeze-base: true  # Start frozen; fine-tune later if needed

# Core hyperparameters
gamma: 1.0         # No discounting - all steps equally predict final outcome
epochs: 3          # 3 passes through 70k examples
batch-size: 32    # Balance between gradient stability and memory
lr: 3e-4           # Standard for Adam with frozen base + small head
